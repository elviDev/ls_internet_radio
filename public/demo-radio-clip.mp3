This is a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would place an actual MP3 file here.
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Record a short audio clip and save it as demo-radio-clip.mp3 in the public folder
2. Or download a royalty-free audio clip and rename it to demo-radio-clip.mp3
3. Or use any existing MP3 file you have

The file should be a short (30-60 second) audio clip that can loop for testing purposes.
